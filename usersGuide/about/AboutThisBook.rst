modules.

How to create this Book from the Sources
----------------------------------------

Within your openWNS SDK execute:

.. code-block:: bash

   > ./playground.py createmanuals

Afterwards, you can find both the html and the pdf files in the
sandbox of your openWNS:

* ``sandbox/default/doc/usersGuide/index.html`` and

* ``sandbox/default/doc/usersGuide/openWNS-UsersGuide.pdf``.

How to change the content of this Book
--------------------------------------

This book is created using Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/). The
content of this book consists of several RST (reStructuredText) files,
which can be found in the directory
``documentation--main--1.0/usersGuide`` in your openWNS directory. For
more information how to use RST (which is really simple), take a look
at http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html.
