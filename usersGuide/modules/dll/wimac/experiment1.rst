Experiment 1: Saturation Throughput
###########################################

In the first experiment, we will setup a very simple simulation campaign, run the
simulations and evaluate the results while learning the basic parts of the WiMAC
configurations.

In the following, we will assume that ``~/myFirstCampaign`` is the root directory 
of the simulation campaign, created as described in the WiFiMAC tutorial section 
``preparation``, and ``~/myFirstCampaign/experiment1`` is the directory where the 
simulations are stored.

In the beginning, this directory contains only the following files:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls
   campaignConfiguration.py   simcontrol.py

``simcontrol.py`` is used to manage the simulation, i.e. to create the scenarios,
execute the simulations (either locally or in a distributed grid, if available) 
and presenting information about the current status. ``campaignConfiguration.py``
contains the parameters which shall be simulated.



*****************************************
Experiment 1 - Offered Traffic (part 1)
*****************************************

The first scenario is kept as simple as possible:
One Base Station (BS) and one Mobile Station (MS) transmit data in uplink and downlink,
within a distance `d`.

1. In this simulation, we would like to measure the saturation throughput
   in downlink and uplink. Accordingly, we need to create a
   set of simulations with increasing offered traffic and plot the
   carried throughput versus offered traffic.
   Each simulation campaign, independent of its complexity, follows four
   basic steps:

   a. Create the simulation configuration file, :ref:`experiment1FirstConfig` - 
      this one is the same for all simulations.

   #. Create the parameter file, :ref:`experiment1FirstCampaignConfig` - this one
      contains the parameters that differentiate the simulations from each other,
      i.e. the different offered traffic in our case.

   #. Run the simulations using :ref:`experiment1FirstSimcontrol`.

   #. View results using the :ref:`experiment1FirstWrowser`.


.. _experiment1FirstConfig:



config.py
---------

To complete the campaign, a configuration file ``config.py`` is required that 
configures the scenario, stations and the evaluation. For the first experiment, a 
config.py can be found in 
``myOpenWNS/tests/system/wimac-tests/PyConfig/experiment1/``, this 
file needs to be copied into the simulations directory 
(``myFirstCampaign/experiment1``):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd ~/myFirstCampaign/experiment1
   $ cp ~/myOpenWNS/tests/system/wimac-tests/PyConfig/experiment1/config.py .

Take a look at the first lines of the configuration file ``config.py`` and you 
can see how to adjust the parameters of this scenario:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.config.simulationParameter
   :language: python

The most important statement is the first one:

.. code-block:: python

   from openwns.wrowser.simdb.SimConfig import params

Here, a parameter class ``params`` is imported. It is required for the
automatic generation of scenarios in the campaign: the object
``params`` contains member variables for every parameter that will be
changed in the campaign. In this case, it is the offered traffic ``params.offeredTraffic``.

Besides these parameters, this section also sets the packet size, the packet scheduling strategy, simulation's settling time and five other parameters.

.. _experiment1FirstCampaignConfig:



campaignConfiguration.py
------------------------

To set different values for the parameters of the simulations, a second file besides the
``config.py`` is necessary: the ``campaignConfiguration.py``.
For the first experiment, a prepared ``campaignConfiguration.py`` can be found in
``~/myOpenWNS/tests/system/wimac-tests/PyConfig/experiment1/``, this
file needs to be copied into the simulations directory, overwriting the existing one:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cp ~/myOpenWNS/tests/system/wimac-tests/PyConfig/experiment1/campaignConfiguration.py .

Two sections in this files are especially interesting for the simulation: First, 
the parameter class ``Set`` is defined that contains all simulation parameters that
are used in ``config.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.campaignConfiguration.Set
   :language: python

Next, an instance with the same name as in the ``config.py`` is created:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.campaignConfiguration.params
   :language: python

.. The class ``Set`` contains the function ``setDefaults()``. Calling this functions,
   default values are defined for all parameters.

Then, the parameters in ``params`` can be populated with different values. Each 
time the ``write()`` member function (inherited from the class ``Parameters``) is
called, the current values are fixed and represent one simulation:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.campaignConfiguration.offeredTraffic
   :language: python

With this setup, 5 simulations are created, differentiated by the
offered downlink traffic between 0.01 and 10.01 Mbps. This concludes the file 
``campaignConfiguration.py``.

.. _experiment1FirstSimcontrol:



simcontrol.py
-------------

We are now ready to create the simulations and let them run.  As mentioned earlier,
simulation execution is controlled by the script ``simcontrol.py``. With the command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./simcontrol.py --create-database

Tip: You do not have to typre the full option. As long as it is unique you can just type the beginning. In this case ``--create-d`` will also work to create the database.

The ``campaignConfiguration.py`` is executed and the parameter values
are written to the database. Then, the command

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./simcontrol.py --create-scenarios

reads the database and creates a sub-directory for every scenario. 
This can be validated by calling

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./simcontrol.py -i

      id   state        [...]       offeredTraffic
        1  NotQueued                      10000.0
        2  NotQueued                    2510000.0
        3  NotQueued                    5010000.0
        4  NotQueued                    7510000.0
        5  NotQueued                   10010000.0

Before running all simulations, a single one can be tested (e.g. for typos in 
``config.py``) by changing into one of the new created directories and running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./openwns-dbg

If everything works right, the logging output of the simulation is printed 
(consisting of the simulation time, the module, and the output), until the
simulation time reaches 1.1 seconds and the simulation ends with

.. code-block:: bash

   wns::simulator::Application: shutdown complete

Have a look at the output of the traffic source and sink ``CONST``. How many packts were generated, how many were successfully received?

After this test, the simulations can be run one-by-one using the ``simcontrol.py`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./simcontrol.py --execute-locally 
   Executing scenario with id: 1
   Executing scenario with id: 2
   Executing scenario with id: 3
   Executing scenario with id: 4
   Executing scenario with id: 5


This starts the serial execution of all defined scenarios. In a "production" 
environment, a grid engine could be used to queue all simulations and run them
in parallel; the script is configured to work together with the SunGridEngine_ [#]_
e.g. with the command instead:


.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./simcontrol.py --queue-scenarios 

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] Optionally, if you use the SunGridEngine_, you can modify the ``simcontrol.py``
   in order boost the priority of our simulations by editing the ``estimated cpu time``
   from the default value of 100 hours to 1h. Find the appropriate line by 
   looking for 'cpu-time' or the number `100`.

.. _SunGridEngine: http://gridengine.sunsource.net/

The installation and configuration of this grid is out of the scope of this tutorial.

After some time, all 6 simulations should be finished, which can be controlled again with

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./simcontrol.py -i

    id    state  [...]  simTime prog   sgeId host   offeredTraffic  
    1   Finished         1.10s  100.00%                   10000.0
    2   Finished         1.10s  100.00%                 2510000.0
    3   Finished         1.10s  100.00%                 5010000.0
    4   Finished         1.10s  100.00%                 7510000.0
    5   Finished         1.10s  100.00%                10010000.0
    
Each simulation directory now contains a directory ``output``, where all probe 
output is stored in text files. Additionally, the output is stored in the 
database, which can be accessed much more user-friendly than viewing text files.

.. _experiment1FirstWrowser:



Wrowser
-------

The Wrowser ("Wireless network simulator Result brOWSER") is the openWNS graphical
user interface to browse, i.e. plot, simulation results in a fast and convenient 
way. We assume that the Wrowser is installed according to :ref:`gettingStartedWrowser`.
Thus, the Wrowser is started by calling

.. code-block:: bash

   $ wrowser

In the menu ``File`` are the different options to read the generated simulation data,
we select ``Open Campaign Database`` and then under the appropriate user the 
campaign with the chosen name, see :ref:`figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-selectCampaign`.

.. _figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-selectCampaign:

.. figure:: images/experiment1-wrowser-selectCampaign.*
   :align: center

   Campaign selection

After reading the simulation parameters from the database, the
Wrowser will display all possible parameter combinations, see
:ref:`figure-wifimac-experiment1-wrowser-parameter`.

.. _figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-parameter:

.. figure:: images/experiment1-wrowser-parameter.*
   :align: center

   Parameter selection

We do not want to deselect any of the simulations, but draw the graph of the offered
traffic versus the obtained throughput measured by the top MAC-Layer. Thus, the 
Wrowser needs to get, for all six simulations, the throughput, combine it with 
the offered traffic parameter and draw this to a graph. This type of combination
plot is named "Parameter Plot" in the Wrowser. We select Figure -> New -> Parameter.
In the new window, the simulation parameter has to be set to ``offeredTraffic``,
this will be displayed on the x-axis. For the y-axis, we select ``wimac.top.window.incoming.bitThroughput_BS_Id1_PDF.dat``
and select ``Draw`` in the bottom to see a figure as in :ref:`figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-throughput`.

.. _figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-throughput:

.. figure:: images/experiment1-wrowser-throughput.*
   :align: center

   Throughput plot

In the new figure, we should see that the uplink traffic has reached the saturation
point at 7.3 Mbps. Now check the downlink.

Can you verify the results analytically: There are 384 OFDM subcarriers in a symbol at 5MHz bandwidth. 18 symbols are available for user data in every 5ms frame. Modulation is QAM64 (``~/myOpenWNS/modules/wimac/PyConfig/wimac/LLMapping.py``), coding rate is 0.917 (``~/myOpenWNS/framework/rise/PyConfig/rise/CoderSpecification.py``).

Another interesting figure is the relation of offered traffic versus the packet 
delay, evaluated as a probability function. This can be done by choosing a 
``PDF/CDF/CCDF`` graph in the ``Figure`` menu and plotting the probe 
``wimac.top.packet.incoming.delay_BS_Id1_PDF`` 

The Packet Delay is only meaningful in underload, because the infinite delay of 
lost or dropped packets in overload is not considered in this metric. From the 
previous figure we can derive the saturation throughput. Therefore 
we deselect the last two simulations with a  ``offeredTraffic`` beyond 7.3Mbps. Try also the ``Filter Expression`` box to deselect traffics beyong the saturation point.
In the ``Configure Graph`` menu which is called using the button next to the ''Draw'' 
button, we select the ``Line markers`` as ``None``. 

:ref:`figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-configureGraph_b`.

.. _figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-configureGraph_b:

.. figure:: images/experiment1-wrowser-configureGraph_b.*
   :align: center

   configure graph


we can see that the probability for a higher delay increases as the offered traffic increases, see 


:ref:`figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-uplink-delay`.

.. _figure-wimac-experiment1-wrowser-uplink-delay:

.. figure:: images/experiment1-wrowser-uplink-delay.*
   :align: center

   Delay plot

Now compare uplink and downlink delays for 5.01 Mbps. How is the delay distributed? Why do the results differ? Tip: This is a Time Division Duplex (TDD) configuration. 

*******
Details
*******

So far, we have just used the prepared ``config.py``, without the knowledge how
it generates the simulation scenario. In the following sections, we will go step
by step through the different parts of the ``config.py`` and learn what is necessary
to setup the scenario and the WiMAC module.



Simulation Parameters
---------------------

The file ``config.py`` for this scenario begins with the simulation
parameters to allow for a better overview and an easy change of
parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.config.simulationParameter
   :language: python

The statement ``from openwns.wrowser.simdb.SimConfig import params`` is required for the
automatic generation of scenarios in the campaign: the object
``params`` contains member variables for every parameter that will be
changed in the campaign. In this case, they are

#. the carrier bandwidth (bandwidth),
#. the distance between the BS and the MS (distance) and
#. the offered traffic (offeredTraffic).

Besides these parameters, this section also sets the packet size, the packet scheduling
strategy, simulation's settling time and five other parameters.



Import Statements
-----------------

Then the Python code that generates the scenario starts. First, several modules are imported:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.config.imports
   :language: python

Namely, we import

* The random number generator

* The simulator core ``openwns``, which includes different types of libraries e.g.
  classes to define dB, dBm and an interval.

* The scenario package to define the radio environment.

* The IP Backbone Helpers for DNS, DHCP and ARP (all done virtually)

* From wimac:

  - The nodecreator package that allows the generation of stations
  - The WiMAC Helpers to setup traffic, the scheduler and the channel model
  - The evaluation structure for the WiMAC



WNS Core Configuration
----------------------

The next section creates one instance of the openWNS

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.config.WNS
   :language: python

The output strategy ``DELETE`` assures that old simulation output is
deleted prior to the simulation. The write interval of the
status-report and the probes is set.



Scenario
--------

The scenario building basically consists of the following definitions

* the positions of stations
* the transceivers
* the protocol stacks of the MAC

After passing the default configuration Config.parametersPhy to the wimac module, the
creation of the scenario instance is done by using the scenario and wimac module;

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.config.scenario
   :language: python

The positions of the stations can be defined by using the placers. (e.g. 
``HexagonalPlacer``, ``LinearPlacer``) which guarantee a specific distribution of
the positions. Here, the positions of BSs comply a hexagonal grid with the 
chosen number of rings ``numberOfCircles`` around a center cell. All positions 
of MSs are on a line according to the position list ``positionList``. Because we 
only study a scenario with one BS and one MS we chose ``numberOfCircles`` equal 
to zero and ``numberOfNodes`` equal to one. The different types of placers can 
be chosen from the python classes in the path ``~/myOpenWNS/framework/scenarios/PyConfig/scenarios/placer/``.

Next, the antenna type of the BS is defined with a position offset relative to the
BS positions. Here we only have one antenna per BS with a height of 5 meters.

The protocol stack of the stations is defined by the creator. The creators ``WiMAXBSCreator`` and ``WiMAXUECreator`` are used, which can be found
in ``nodecreators.py`` in the folder ``myOpenWNS/modules/dll/wimac/PyConfig/wimac/support/``.

The scenario is built by the ``scenarios.builders.CreatorPlacerBuilder`` using the
above mentioned parameters and functions.



Radio Channel
-------------

The configuration of the radio channel propagation parameters contains modules for three major effects:

* Pathloss,
* Shadowing and
* Fast fading

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.config.radioChannel
   :language: python

Line-of-Side Test (LoS_Test) radio channel is chosen. More details about how the
radio channel can be configured can be found in the file ``wimac.support.helper.py``.



Evaluation
----------

In the final lines, the evaluation is installed, creating probe output
for the WiMAC station types BSs and MSs with a certain window and settling time:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../.createManualsWorkingDir/wimac.tutorial.experiment1.config.Probing
   :language: python



************************************* 
Experiment 1 - Bandwidth (part 2) 
************************************* 

2. Find the impact of increased ``bandwidth`` from 5MHz to 10 and 20 MHz on the 
   saturation throughput by editing the ``campaignConfiguration.py``. and ``config.py``.

   a. Change the static setting in ``config.py`` to a variable parameter that gets
      its value from the imported instance ``params``.

   #. Add the parameter ``bandwidth`` to the class ``Set`` in the ``campaignConfiguration.py``.
      As existing simulations do not have this parameter, but have used 5MHz, we
      add this as the default value by specifying::

            bandwidth = Int(default = 5)

   #. Modify the existing for-loop to generate different offered traffic between 
      0.001 and 35.001 Mbps. Add an inner for-loop to vary the bandwidth between
      5 and 20 MHz::

            for rate in [0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 30, 35]:
                for bandw in [5,10,20]:
                    params.offeredTraffic = (0.01 + rate) * 1e6
                    params.bandwidth = bandw
                    params.write()


   #. It is not necessary to delete existing scenarios, ``simcontrol.py`` will
      automatically identify the missing simulations and create them when told so.
      Every time you modify the campaign parameters, first call ``simcontrol.py --create-database``
      to add entries to the database and ``simcontrol.py --create-scenarios`` to
      create the simulation directories accordingly. Create the simulations (in 
      the database and the scenarios). Use ``simcontrol.py -i`` to assure everything went right. Execute the simulations using ``./simcontrol.py --execute-locally --restrict-state=NotQueued`` to assure only the new simulations are executed. 

   #. Evaluate the impact of the bandwidth on the saturation point using the Wrowser.




***********************************
Experiment 1 - Distance (part 3)
***********************************

3. Now, we want to vary another parameter ``distance`` to select a distance between 
   BS and MS of 0.2km to 12km (with an offered traffic of 10.01 Mbps and a 
   bandwidth of 5 MHz).

   a. Change the static setting in ``config.py`` to a variable parameter that gets its value from the imported instance ``params``.

   #. Add the parameter ``distance`` to the class ``Set`` in the
      ``campaignConfiguration.py``. As existing simulations do not
      have this parameter, but have used 100m, we add this as the default value by specifying::

            distance = Float(default=100.0)

   #. Replace the existing for-loop by the following code to vary the distance 
      between 2100m and 12100m::

            for rate in [0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 30, 35]:
                for bandw in [5,10,20]:
                    for dist in xrange(0,6):
                        params.offeredTraffic = (0.01 + rate) * 1e6
                        params.bandwidth = bandw
                        params.distance = 100 + dist * 2000
                        params.write()

   #. Create the simulations (in the database and the scenarios). Check them using the ``-i`` switch. You will see ``None`` at 100m distance, this is because two default parameters are not supported (yet).

   #. To save time only run the simulations for 10.01Mbps and 5MHz. This is done using the option ``--restrict-expression="bandwidth==5 and offeredTraffic==10.01E6" --restrict-state=NotQueued``. 

   #. Evaluate the impact of the ``distance`` on the saturation point using the Wrowser. Use the ``toggle`` button to select the right simulations. Be sure to deselect the empty distance.

The right way to carry out these simulations would have been creating a new subcampaign to just simulate the parameters of interest. Creating subcampaigns will be discussed in the next experiment.
