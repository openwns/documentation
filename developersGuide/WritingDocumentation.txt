@page wns_documentation_writingdocumentation Writing Documentation

Documentation is written in the Doxygen style inline with the source or
in separate files.

@section wns_documentation_writingdocumentation_extracting Extracting Examples

Whenever you write documentation for a piece of code it should remain valid
throughout the lifetime of that code. If the code changes, the documentation
should be adopted. However, this is a tedious process and cannot be
automated. Human beings often forget to update the documentation whenever
their code changes.

Therefore, it is explicitely encouraged to extract examples from unit tests that
are contained within the main test suite. The commit policy enforces that
all tests in the main test suite must succeed before commiting. If you extract
your examples from these tests, then it is quite clear that all your examples
will either remain valid or will be changed by developers if the break them.

You can mark a code snippet by using the @em begin \em example and
@em endexample environment. The examples will be automatically
extracted by @em playground.py and will be made available to
Doxygen for reference. Below is an example of this.

@code

// begin example "wns.avaragetest.header.example"
#include <WNS/Average.hpp>
#include <WNS/TestFixture.hpp>

namespace wns { namespace tests {
	class AverageTest : public CppUnit::TestFixture  {
		CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( AverageTest );
		CPPUNIT_TEST( testPutAndGet );
		CPPUNIT_TEST( testReset );
		CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
	public:
		void setUp();
		void tearDown();
		void testPutAndGet();
		void testReset();
	private:
		Average<double> average;
	};
}}
// end example
@endcode

@section wns_documentation_writingdocumentation_including Including Examples

You can include an example in some other doxygen documentation by 
using the @em \@include statement of doxygen. Just reference your
example by its name and it will be rendered in place.

@include wns.avaragetest.header.example

The code of this section is
