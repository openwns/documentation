/**
@page installation Installation

After you have successfully downloaded (see @ref download) openWNS you
are ready to install openWNS. Make sure you satisfy all @ref
prerequisites.

The installation itself is quite easy:

@verbatim
./playground.py install dbg
@endverbatim

After building has finished you can find the respective modules in
@c './sandbox/dbg/'.

Under @c './sandbox/dbg/bin/' you should find a binary which is called
@c 'openwns'. If you want to check if everything worked change to:

@verbatim
cd tests/unit/unitTests
@endverbatim

and say

@verbatim
./openwns -t -v
@endverbatim

@c -t runs all available unit tests and @c -v puts @c openwns into verbose mode
(@c --help shows all available options).
