Why do we need a style guide for openWNS?
-----------------------------------------

This describes the coding conventions (guidelines, styles, rules, ... whatever you want) applying to the openWNS standard library and the main distribution. This style guide is insipred from "Style Guide for Python Code" (Python Enhancement Proposal: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) .

To give you an idea why these guidelines exists, we can again refer to "Style Guide for Python Code":

::

    One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it
    is written.  The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the
    readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of
    Python code.  As PEP 20 says, "Readability counts".

    A style guide is about consistency.  Consistency with this style guide is
    important.  Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency
    within one module or function is most important.

    But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes the style
    guide just doesn't apply.  When in doubt, use your best judgment.  Look
    at other examples and decide what looks best.  And don't hesitate to ask!

    Two good reasons to break a particular rule:

    (1) When applying the rule would make the code less readable, even for
        someone who is used to reading code that follows the rules.

    (2) To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for
        historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to clean up
        someone else's mess (in true XP style).

Code layout
-----------

Indenting
'''''''''

**Use 4 spaces per indentation level.**

If tabs are used for indentation many editors mix tabs and spaces to get a nice indentation. This will result in an ugly indentation if the code is viewed with other settings for the tab-width. Example:

@verbatim
// edited with tab-width: 4

void
Foo::bar(int foo,
         string bar)
{
    // some code here
}
@endverbatim

Since we have 9 characters in front of the type @c string, the editor set to tab-width 4 will use 2 tabs and one space to align @c string with @c int.

Opening this file in an editor with tab-width set to 8 looks like this:

@verbatim#!cplusplus
// viewed with tab-width: 8

void
Foo::bar(int foo,
                 string bar)
{
        // some code here
}
@endverbatim

This is because two tabs à 8 spaces and one space add up to 17 spaces. This means tab-width is not adjustable. Thus the indentation style for openWNS is 4 spaces per indentation level.

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_emacs_indentation Indentation in Emacs

The following shows a c-style for emacs that provides the required indentation rules for the openWNS.

@verbatim
;; The wns-c-style.
(defconst wns-c-style
  '((c-tab-always-indent . t)
    (c-basic-offset . 4)
    (indent-tabs-mode . nil)
    (c-comment-only-line-offset . 4)
    (c-offsets-alist . ((comment-intro . 0)
			(statement-block-intro . +)
			(knr-argdecl-intro . +)
			(substatement-open . 0)
			(label . 0)
			(statement-cont . +)
			(inline-open . 0)
			(inexpr-class . 0)
			(inher-intro . ++)
			))
    ;;(c-echo-syntactic-information-p . t)
    )
  "WNS C/C++ Programming Style")

(c-add-style "WNS" wns-c-style)
@endverbatim
Feel free to include the WNS c-style into you ~/.emacs file.
@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_maximumlinelength Maximum line length

<b>Keep the line length readable</b>

Suggestion is: around 80 characters or up to 10 words. Studies have shown that 10 words text-width are optimal for eye-tracking (from C++ Coding-Standards, Alexandrescu and Sutter, 2004).

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_whitespace Whitespaces

Conventional operators should be surrounded by a space character. C++ reserved words should be followed by a white space.  Commas should be followed by a white space. Semicolons in for statments should be followed by a space character. Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.),
comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <=, >=).

@verbatim
a = (b + c) * d;                // NOT: a=(b+c)*d
while (true)                    // NOT: while(true) { ...
doSomething(a, b, c, d);        // NOT: doSomething(a,b,c,d);
for (int ii = 0; ii < 10; ++ii) // NOT: for(i=0;i<10;i++)
@endverbatim

Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:

Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces. Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call. Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing. To align operators with others.


@verbatim
spam(ham, eggs(2))         // NOT: spam( ham, eggs (2) )
spam(1)                    // NOT: spam (1)
map['key'] = vector[index] // NOT: map ['key'] = vector [index]
int a = 0;                 // NOT: int a     = 0
int b = 0;                 // NOT: int b     = 0
int index = 0;             // NOT: int index = 0
@endverbatim


@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_namespaces Namespaces

@verbatim
namespace a { namespace b { namespace c {

} // namespace c
} // namespace b
} // namespace a
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_classes_templates Classes and Templates

@verbatim
template <typename FOO, typename BAR>
class FooBar :
    public virtual SuperClassA
    private SuperClassB
{
public:
    // Public stuff first (most interesting)
protected:
    // Then protected stuff (only interesting if deriving)
private:
    // Last private stuff (internal realization)
};
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_methods Methods
@verbatim
// of course a virtual template method is impossible
// but the keywords should be placed like this
template <typename FOO, typename BAR>
virtual const BAR&
scheduleFooBar(const FOO& foo) const
{
    // some code
}
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_constructors Constructors

@verbatim
// in case you have only one argument don't forget to add
// explicit keyword to avoid automatic type cast
explicit
FooBar::FooBar(Arg arg) :
   SuperClass(arg),
   argument(arg)
{
     // no member initialization here!
}
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_controlstructures Control structures (if, while, for)

@verbatim
if (this->empty() == true)
{
    // some code here
}
else
{
    // some code here
}

while (this->empty() == false)
{
    // some code here
}

for (int ii = 0; ii < 4; ++ii)
{
    // some code here
}
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_typemodifiers Type modifiers

\c * and \c & belong to the type.

@verbatim
int* a = new a;   // NOT: int *a = new a; or int * a = new a;
int& b = c;       // NOT: int &b = c; or int & b = c;
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_comments Comments

Comments are placed above the code block to be commented. Usage of trailing comments is explictly discouraged:
@verbatim
// Yes:
// Make sure the station got registered
if(std::find(stationContainer.begin(), stationContainer.end(), station))
{
    station->move();
}

// No:
if(std::find(stationContainer.begin(), stationContainer.end(), station)) // Make sure the station got registered
{
    station->move();
}
@endverbatim

Don't write comments that just repeat the code. They will likely get out of sync.
@verbatim
// No:
if(!container.empty()) // true if container not empty
{
   container.clear();
}
@endverbatim

Naming Conventions
------------------

Names are always written in CamelCase style. <b>Not</b> in underscore_style. The only exceptions are defines (include guards / macros).

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_localvariables Local variables
Variables start lower case, even if they start with an acronym. The acronym is all written in lower case then:
@verbatim
void
someMethod()
{
    double someVariable;
    Station umtsStation;
}
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_methods Methods
Methods start lower case. They describe an action. Therefore, they should contain a verb:
@verbatim
void
sendData(const PDU& pdu)
{
}
@endverbatim

For non-virtual interfaces (NVI)s the method to actually dispatch the request is prefixed with @c do:
@verbatim
void
sendData(const PDU& pdu)
{
    this->doSendData(pdu);
}

virtual void
doSendData(const PDU& pdu) = 0;
@endverbatim

Methods, that represent (asynchronous) event-based interfaces are prefixed @c on:
@verbatim
void
onConnectionEstablished()
{
}
@endverbatim

And for an event-based NVI:
@verbatim
void
onConnectionEstablished()
{
    this->doOnConnectionEstablished();
}
virtual void
doOnConnectionEstablished() = 0;
@endverbatim


@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_classes Classes
Classes start with an upper case letter and are written in CamelCase:
@verbatim
class PositionProvider
{
};
@endverbatim

If a part of the name is an acronym, the acronym is written in upper case letters (or in mixed case if this is the normal way of spelling it):
@verbatim
class UMTSTransmitter
{
};

class WiMAXReceiver
{
};
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_interfaces Interfaces
Interfaces start with an @c I. This avoids name collisions as it is quite common to have IFoo and a class named Foo that implements IFoo.
@verbatim
class IComponent
{
public:
    virtual void
    connect() = 0;
};
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_classmembers Class Members
Scope identification of a variable is important. Is it a local scratch variable or a class member. For easy identification of class members a underscore at the end of the member is used, regardless if the member is private, protected or public:
@verbatim
class Foo
{
private:
    int bar_;
};
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_namespaces Namespaces
Namespace are written all in lowercase letters:

@verbatim
namespace wns { namespace simulator {
}
}

using namespace wns::simulator;
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_templateparameters Template Parameters
Template parameters are written in upper case letters:
@verbatim
template <typename KEY, typename VALUE>
class Registry
{
}
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_macros Macros
Marcos are written in upper case letters. Underscores should be used for better readability. The name should always begin with @c WNS_ to avoid collisions with other macros (e.g. REF and DEREF of Qt).
@verbatim
#define WNS_ADD(x, y) (x)+(y)
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_naming_includingguards Include Guards
Include guards, like Macros, are written in upper case letters with underscores to enhance readability. To avoid name clashes here the following rule must be followed when choosing a name for an include guard:

@c MODULE_DIR_SUBDIR_SUBSUBDIR_FILE

Hence, if the file is placed in the TCP module in @c src/congestion/Tahoe.hpp the include guard is:
@verbatim
#ifndef TCP_CONGESTION_TAHOE_HPP
#define TCP_CONGESTION_TAHOE_HPP
// some code
#endif // NOT defined TCP_CONGESTION_TAHOE_HPP
@endverbatim

At the closing #endif you should state what is (not) defined here.

Programming recommendations
---------------------------

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_programming_rec_namespaces Namespaces

Some rules:
1. Never use @c using @c namespace @c xyz in header files
2. For an implementation: Only use @c using @c namespace @c xyz for the corresponding class definition
3. You should omit the additional namespace qualifiers if you are already in that namespace (e.g. in a class definition)
4. You should always use the full namespace qualifier for any out-of-current-namespace-scope types

@verbatim
namespace foo {
    class Bar
    {
        void
        clone(Bar*);
    };
}

// NOT
namespace foo {
    class Bar
    {
        void
        clone(foo::Bar*);
    };
}
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_programming_rec_comparison Comparison

When testing for something (e.g. in an if-statement), always be explicit about what you expect:

@verbatim
// No

if (foo)

// Yes (because it can be any of these)

// in case of bool
if (foo == true)

// in case of pointer
if (foo != NULL)

// in case of integer
if (foo != 0)
@endverbatim

@subsection wns_coding_guidelines_programming_rec_callbyvalueref Call-by-value, call-by-reference

Use call by reference (const) where possible for complex data types, but always call-by-value for Plain Old Data Types (PODs):

@verbatim
// YES
void
foo(const Bar& bar)

// NO
void
foo(Bar bar)

// NO, only use if you need to modify bar inside foo! and even then with care!
void
foo(Bar& bar)

// NO, only use if you need polymorphism
void
foo(Bar* bar)

// YES
void
foo(double x)

// NO
void
foo(const double& x)

@endverbatim
