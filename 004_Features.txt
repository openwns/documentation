openWNS follows a modular design philosophy. Consequently, even the core itself is managed in different projects:

<ul>

    <li> <b>openWNS SDK</b> - The Software Development Kit that makes your
      development activities. It contains the necessary tools to
      manage the other projects. It is the umbrella/master project for
      all other projects.</li>

    <li> <b>openWNS Library</b> - The core library of openWNS. Current
      feature are:</li>

    <ul>

        <li> Event scheduling system </li>
        <li> Configuration system (PyConfig) </li>
        <li> Logging system </li>
        <li> Random Number Generation </li>
        <li> Memory management (SmartPtr) </li>
        <li> Debugging facilities (Signal handler, C++ backtraces,
        ...) </li>
        <li> Indirect object creation (StaticFactory) </li>

    </ul>

    <li> <b>openWNS Application</b> - The executable and a very simple
      project where you can quickly start off with you own
      extensions.</li>

    <li> <b>openWNS Documentation</b> - Contains general documentation (in
      'Doxygen') about openWNS (how to download, features ...) </li>

</ul>
