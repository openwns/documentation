About this Book
===============

This book is mainly generated by Doxygen. Documentation is written
in Doxygen markup and most of the chapters in this book a extracted
from Doxygen. The openWNS SDK provides helpers to
define the structure of the book and re-order page sections. Doxygen
has no builtin support for this.

.. todo::
   This manual is not created by doxygen anymore. This must be corrected.
   
.. note:: 
   There is some bug in the interaction of Doxygen and Latex. In
   this book every piece of example code is ended with @c \\end{verbatim}
   tag. Please simply ignore this line for now.
